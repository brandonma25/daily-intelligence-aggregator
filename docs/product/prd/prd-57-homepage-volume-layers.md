# PRD-57 — Homepage volume layers

- PRD ID: `PRD-57`
- Canonical file: `docs/product/prd/prd-57-homepage-volume-layers.md`
- Filename rule: use lowercase kebab-case and zero-pad `1` through `9` as `prd-01-...` through `prd-09-...`
- Feature system row: update `docs/product/feature-system.csv` with matching `prd_id` and `prd_file`

## Objective

Expand the public homepage beneath the existing Top 5 Signals layer so the surface expresses the breadth of the governed nine-source public manifest without weakening the editorial sharpness of the top-ranked signal presentation.

## User Problem

The current public homepage exposes only the Top 5 Signals layer plus client-side category tabs that re-filter the same underlying selection. That makes the product feel sparse even when the public manifest is healthy, and it hides the breadth of the available reporting before a reader can absorb the editorial thesis. The result is a surface that looks under-populated at the exact moment when it should demonstrate structured understanding.

## Scope

This feature adds two new Experience-layer modules beneath Top 5 Signals: a Developing Now module and a By Category module. Both modules must consume the existing ranked briefing output and the existing `homepageClassification` / fallback taxonomy path without modifying ingestion, source governance, ranking, or classification rules. Top 5 Signals remains capped at five and keeps its current rendering path. Category tabs remain client-side and keep their current hide-empty-tab behavior.

Developing Now selects from the ranked briefing output after excluding any event already surfaced in Top 5 Signals. Candidates are ordered by a composite of normalized freshness and a source-diversity bonus so the module favors recent developments from sources not already represented in the top layer. The module returns up to ten items, degrades honestly to fewer when supply is thin, and suppresses semantic near-duplicates so it does not restate the same story family with weaker phrasing.

By Category renders three subsections in the fixed order Tech, Finance, Politics. Each subsection selects up to three fresh events whose `classification.primaryCategory` matches the category key, while excluding anything already used in Top 5 Signals or Developing Now. Subsections do not borrow from one another. Politics preserves the existing honest empty-state rule rather than backfilling with Tech or Finance coverage.

## Non-Goals

This feature does not introduce story clusters, multi-article grouping, access-type metadata, personalization, new routes, manifest edits, ingestion changes, ranking changes, or taxonomy redesign. It also does not change the existing category-tab interaction model or the Top 5 Signals cap and rendering path.

## Implementation Shape / System Impact

The implementation lives in the homepage view-model and rendering layers. `src/lib/homepage-model.ts` gains pure selection helpers for Developing Now and category previews, plus a wrapper that adds these selections to the homepage view model. The homepage component renders the new modules beneath the existing Top 5 Signals experience and reuses the existing lighter category card treatment rather than introducing new design primitives.

The key editorial choice is to reject a simple “positions 6–15” module. That approach is structurally redundant with Top 5 Signals because it only extends the same ranking story with weaker items. Source-diverse freshness is a distinct job: it answers what is newly building from sources not already represented above, which broadens awareness without diluting the understanding-first role of Top 5.

Hostname-derived source keys are acceptable for this release because briefing items do not carry a stable source identifier. Diversity scoring will therefore treat multiple Reuters feeds under the same hostname as one editorial source when the URL pattern resolves that way. Future manifest additions must verify that the URL pattern either resolves distinctly or that any collision is editorially acceptable.

## Dependencies / Risks

This feature depends on the current governed contracts from PRD-17, PRD-36, PRD-46, and PRD-54 remaining unchanged. The main implementation risk is over-surfacing semantically repetitive stories beneath the Top 5 layer, so the new selection logic must preserve the existing semantic-dedup behavior already used elsewhere in the homepage model. A secondary risk is thin category supply, especially in Politics; the design must degrade to honest empty states instead of manufacturing filler.

## Acceptance Criteria

When public source supply is healthy, the homepage surfaces materially more than five distinct events across Top 5 Signals, Developing Now, and By Category. Developing Now must exclude Top 5 IDs, favor fresher items, prefer sources not already represented in Top 5, and return no semantic near-duplicates of already surfaced stories. By Category must render Tech, Finance, and Politics in that order, show up to three fresh items per subsection, never overlap with Top 5 or Developing Now, and preserve honest empty-state behavior when a category has no eligible items. The existing Top 5 Signals path, category-tab behavior, public manifest, ranking logic, and Politics empty-state invariant must remain intact.

## Evidence and Confidence

- Repo evidence used: `src/lib/homepage-model.ts`, `src/components/landing/homepage.tsx`, `src/components/home/CategoryTabStrip.tsx`, `src/lib/homepage-taxonomy.ts`, `docs/product/prd/prd-17-homepage-intelligence-surface.md`, `docs/product/prd/prd-36-signal-display-cap.md`, `docs/product/prd/prd-46-home-category-tabs.md`, `docs/product/prd/prd-54-public-source-manifest.md`, `docs/engineering/bug-fixes/phase1/post-cluster-surfacing-quality.md`, `docs/engineering/bug-fixes/phase1/homepage-semantic-dedup-and-explanations.md`
- Confidence: Medium-high. The surface and invariants are well defined, and the implementation is scoped to additive view-model and UI work.
