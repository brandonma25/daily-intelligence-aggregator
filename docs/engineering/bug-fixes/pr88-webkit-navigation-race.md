# PR88 WebKit Navigation Race — Bug-Fix Record

## Summary
- Problem addressed: PR88's `PR Gate / pr-e2e-webkit` check failed during merge validation.
- Root cause: The new Playwright audit tests moved between Next.js routes immediately after `domcontentloaded` or URL-change detection. WebKit can still have a prior client-side navigation in flight, which caused `page.goto()` to fail with an interrupted-navigation error.

## Fix
- Exact change: Added a shared audit navigation helper that waits for route load state, verifies the target pathname, and retries only the known interrupted-navigation case. Updated route traversal and desktop navigation tests to use that helper.
- Related PRD: None. This is unmapped operations QA automation work for PR88.

## Validation
- Automated checks:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run lint || true`
  - `npm run test || true`
  - `npm run build`
  - `PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_WEBSERVER=1 ... npx playwright test tests/audit/route-traversal.spec.ts tests/navigation/app-navigation.spec.ts --project=webkit --workers=1`
  - `PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_WEBSERVER=1 ... npm run test:e2e:webkit`
  - `CI=1 PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_WEBSERVER=1 ... npm run test:e2e:webkit`
  - `npm run dev`, then `curl -I http://localhost:3000/` and `curl -I http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- Human checks: Preview and real auth/session validation remain required before merge readiness.

## Tracker Closeout
- Google Sheets tracker row updated and verified: No direct Sheets access was used in this session.
- Fallback tracker-sync file, if direct Sheets update was unavailable: `docs/operations/tracker-sync/2026-04-21-playwright-ui-audit-automation.md`

## Remaining Risks / Follow-up
- Re-run PR88's GitHub `pr-e2e-webkit` check after this patch is pushed.
- Preview gate and human auth/session gate remain outside local Playwright validation.
