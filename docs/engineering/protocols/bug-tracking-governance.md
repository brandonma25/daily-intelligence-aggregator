# Bug Tracking Governance

## Purpose
- Define the lightweight repo-safe path from bug discovery to bug-fix documentation to governance enforcement.
- Make bug-fix work traceable without forcing every small fix into a new product PRD.

## Canonical Bug-Fix Lane
- Defect records live in `docs/engineering/bug-fixes/`.
- Use one bug-fix record per meaningful defect or tightly related defect family.
- Prefer updating the existing bug-fix record instead of creating `v2`, `final`, `follow-up`, or duplicate files for the same root cause.

## When a Bug-Fix Record Is Required
- A branch or PR is explicitly framed as a fix, bug, hotfix, or regression repair.
- A non-trivial defect changes runtime, data, automation, workflow, or release behavior.
- The fix has a root cause, risk, or follow-up expectation that future maintainers should understand.

## When a Bug-Fix Record Is Usually Not Required
- Pure docs-only corrections.
- Tiny typo-only code changes with no real defect narrative.
- Structural repo cleanup that truthfully belongs in `docs/engineering/change-records/`.
- A new system or feature that should be documented primarily through a PRD instead of a bug record.

## Required Minimum Content
- Problem addressed.
- Root cause.
- Exact fix applied.
- Validation performed.
- Remaining risks or follow-up.

## Cross-Reference Rules
- If the bug repair materially changes an existing numbered feature, reference the canonical `PRD-XX` inside the bug-fix record.
- If the work changes a governance rule or release behavior, also update the relevant protocol or change-record doc.
- Do not copy the same narrative into the PRD, bug-fix record, and testing note; keep each document truthful to its job.

## Enforcement Link
- `scripts/validate-documentation-coverage.py` detects fix-signaled work and requires a `bug-fix` documentation lane update for meaningful non-test changes.
- `scripts/release-governance-gate.py` reuses that same coverage logic for blocking enforcement.

## Naming Guidance
- Prefer concise kebab-case file names that describe the defect, for example `oauth-session-persistence.md`.
- If the defect is tightly tied to a canonical PRD, `prd-XX-<slug>.md` is acceptable when it makes the relationship clearer.

## Template
- Use `docs/engineering/bug-fixes/templates/bug-fix-record-template.md` for new meaningful bug-fix records.
